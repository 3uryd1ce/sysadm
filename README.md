# System administration tools

An unsorted collection of tools and configs. In retrospect, it
doesn't make much sense to lump everything together into one
repository, so I'm in the process of refactoring, documenting and
publishing some of this software separately.

Here is a list of things that have moved to their own repositories:

- genblock is now [domain-sift](https://github.com/3uryd1ce/domain-sift)
- translate_wg_conf is now [wg_to_hostname_if](https://github.com/3uryd1ce/wg_to_hostname_if)
